Data interoperability between domain-specific applications is a key prerequisite for building information modeling (BIM) to solidify its position as a central medium for collaboration and information sharing in the construction industry. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) provides an open and neutral data format to standardize data exchanges in BIM, but is often exposed to data loss and misclassifications. Concretely, errors in mappings between BIM elements and IFC entities may occur due to manual omissions or the lack of awareness of the IFC schema itself, which is broadly defined and highly complex. This study explored the use of geometric deep learning models to classify infrastructure BIM elements, with the ultimate goal of automating the prechecking of BIM-to-IFC mappings. Two models with proven classification performance, Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN) and PointNet, were trained and tested to classify 10 types of commonly used BIM elements in road infrastructure, using a dataset of 1496 3D models. Results revealed MVCNN as the superior model with ACC and F1 score values of 0.98 and 0.98, compared with PointNet's corresponding values of 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. MVCNN, which employs multiple images to learn the features of a 3D artifact, was able to discern subtle differences in their shapes and geometry. PointNet seems to lose the granularity of the shapes, as it uses points partially selected from point clouds.

特定领域的应用程序之间的数据互操作性是建筑信息模型（BIM）巩固其作为建筑业合作和信息共享的核心媒介地位的关键前提。工业基础类（IFC）提供了一种开放和中立的数据格式，以规范BIM中的数据交换，但经常暴露于数据丢失和错误分类。具体来说，BIM元素和IFC实体之间的映射错误可能是由于人工遗漏或缺乏对IFC模式本身的认识而发生的，IFC模式定义广泛且高度复杂。这项研究探索了使用几何深度学习模型对基础设施BIM元素进行分类，最终目的是实现BIM到IFC映射的自动化预检查。使用1496个三维模型的数据集，对多视图卷积神经网络（MVCNN）和PointNet这两个分类性能得到验证的模型进行了训练和测试，对道路基础设施中常用的10种BIM元素进行分类。结果显示，MVCNN是卓越的模型，其ACC和F1得分值分别为0.98和0.98，而PointNet的相应值为0.83和0.87。MVCNN采用多幅图像来学习三维人工制品的特征，能够分辨出其形状和几何的细微差别。PointNet似乎失去了形状的颗粒度，因为它使用的是部分从点云中选择的点。  
  
摘要这段写得很好，写明了“为什么已经有模型，还需要机器学习来分类的目的”，但和我的课题要求有一点点区别。
